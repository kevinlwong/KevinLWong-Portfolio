                <h1>About <span>Me</span></h1>
                <h3>Hello! I'm Kevin Wong.</h3>
                <p>My hobbies consist of working out, kickboxing, relaxing with my dog, and spending time with friends
                    and family. I also love to dance and I am currently the Treasurer of Cal Poly Pomona’s hip-hop dance
                    team, Inner Essence Dance Company. Since I assumed this position, I have helped the team gain $6,500
                    through donations and fundraisers, and I am constantly in charge of our team’s finances, payments,
                    and budgets.
                    <br><br> I chose my current field of study because as a child, I always admired my father and his
                    work with computers. I learned that he majored in Computer Science at SFSU and while I was in high school, I
                    decided to
                    follow in his
                    footsteps. In addition to this, my love for technology and building digital solutions that can help solve
                    and deal with real world
                    problems motivated me even more to pursue this career.
                <h2>What skills or experiences am I looking to gain in an internship?
                </h2>
                <p>I am looking to gain more collaborative and teamwork-related skills, technical oral and verbal
                    communication skills, and an opportunity to learn from professionals in the industry while adapting
                    to new working environments. I look forward to gaining as much knowledge as I can and using that to
                    help my peers as well as those that I will serve.
